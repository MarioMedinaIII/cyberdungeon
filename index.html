            their information. Throughout the course of this game you will learn more about scams, malware, social 
            media and online shopping safety, data mining, and dark patterns. There are six levels and each level

        <H2>About Us</H2>
        <p>This game was created by Mario Medina, Jinheng Hu, Jhoonho Kim as a capstone project. The topic of our 
            capstone was privacy. What we wanted to do was create a way for people to learn about online privacy in a 
            way that is also entertaining. We decided that creating an educational video game would be the best way to 
            do this because who doesn't like video games. The reason why it is so important to keep people educated on 
            this topic is because technology has become increasingly more ingrained in almost every aspect in life with 
            the rise of surveillance capitalism. It has become more invasive as various aspects of our lives can be 
            tracked, monitored, and collected for companies' own gain at the expense of our privacy. Companies make it 
            harder and trickier for people to opt out of getting their information mined and profited upon. Many tend 
            to not know what they are getting into when they agree to things online so itâ€™s important to educate them 
            so they can make an informed decision about whether or not they want to accept the next terms and agreement 
            or accept cookies button they come across.</p>
